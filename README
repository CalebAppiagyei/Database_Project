Using containers and docker-compose:
1. Make sure that you have installed `Docker Desktop` and that it is currently running

2. go to terminal and execute `docker login container.cs.vt.edu` and sign in with GitLab details

3. Make sure your local mysql service is not running:
    - Press `windows button` -> Search and select `services` -> Scroll down to `MySQL80` and select -> Select to `stop the service` on the left

4. Build the backend and frontend containers:
    - Navigate to the root directory and execute `fakemake.sh`
    - Wait for all of the containers to be built (Depending on how much you changed, this could take a while)
    - Do `docker-compose up` to start the containers

5. View the application:
    - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` (This should be where the application is being hosted)

Troubleshooting:

1. Database not found:
    - back-1   | Error connecting to the database: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND database
    back-1   |     at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookupall [as oncomplete] (node:dns:120:26)
    
    - Fix: Go to docker desktop and look at the name of the collection of containers
        - Go to the `config.json` file in the Back
        - Edit the `host` to be `<name>-mysql-1`
