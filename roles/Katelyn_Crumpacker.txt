In the development of this project, I took on more of an organizational role. When submitting the final project,
I made sure that each piece of the report, video, and repository was included. I wrote a lot of the report, and as
the phases of the project moved a long I kept all of our phase reports and diagrams organized. For the actual project
content, I sort of helped where I was needed. I worked on the Frontend by doing expanding the admin view, creating 
the compare view, and working on the report functionality. I also aided a little bit in the backend by working on a few
endpoint functions. I was worked on the creation of the database structure and schema in MySQL. My role in this project
was really just to fill in any gaps and help organize our final report.
